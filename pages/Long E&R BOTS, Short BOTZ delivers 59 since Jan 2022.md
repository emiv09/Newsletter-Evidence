title: Long E&R BOTS, Short BOTZ delivers 59% since Jan 2022
---

Since January 2022, a strategy involving going long on E&R BOTS and short on the MCAP weighted BOTZ index would have achieved a 59% return over 26 months.

BOTZ represents a key ETF of leading Robotics and AI companies, managing nearly $3 billion in assets across more than eight years of trading. Given that three stocks constitute over 30% of its weight, it's reasonable to conclude that the ETF’s underlying benchmark follows a market capitalization (MCAP) weighting approach.

By applying the [3N] Methodology to devise a comparable mandate, the E&R BOTZ variant significantly outperformed, indicating the potential of a long E&R BOTZ and short MCAP weighted BOTZ strategy to yield a substantial 59% absolute return within just over two years.
