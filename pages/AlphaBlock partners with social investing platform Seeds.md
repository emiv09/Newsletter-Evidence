# AlphaBlock partners with social investing platform Seeds to launch blue chip Smart Beta Stock Index in Indonesia

AlphaBlock partners with social investing platform Seeds to launch blue chip Smart Beta Stock Index in Indonesia 

AlphaBlock Technologies Inc. (“AlphaBlock”) today announced that it is launching a new blue chip stock index in partnership with Seeds, an Indonesian social investing platform. The new index, called Exceptional & Rich Indonesia 30, will use AlphaBlock’s open indexing method to enable a smart beta portfolio that is expected to outperform the IDX 30, similar to what AlphaBlock has done against the S&P 500 index in the USA. 

AlphaBlock, which is garnering attention for its investor-friendly “pay-for-alpha” approach (where investors avoid paying fees when investments underperform and share modest fees on outperformance), is excited to tap into the Indonesian market, which is predicted to become the 4th largest economy in the world by 2045 reaching $9.1 trillion, with a per capita income expected to reach $29,000. Indonesia's economy is currently the 16th largest economy in the world with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $1.19 trillion in 2021. The country is the largest economy in Southeast Asia. 

According to Mukul Pal, CEO of AlphaBlock, “Today’s market capitalization weighted indices barely allocate 2% weight to Indonesia in the Emerging Market Group. Most popular ETFs allocate 70% of the weight to China, India, Taiwan and South Korea. We think we can deliver a better index.” AlphaBlock plans to build a suite of solutions starting with a blue chip, diversified, non-concentrated index which Seeds can offer as Electronic Investment Funds to their existing clients on a pay-for-alpha basis. 

“We are excited about this partnership” said Willy Tan, CEO of Seeds, “because it helps us extend our product line to our existing clients and build more market-wide awareness about delivering alpha, beating the market through AI solutions. We are a social investing fintech in South East Asia and need to constantly adapt to the evolving landscape. Technological change is a big driver and we want to be early adopters of such innovations, helping retail investors participate and achieve greater impact.”
