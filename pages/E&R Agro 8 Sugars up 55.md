# E&R Agro 8 Sugars up 55%!


Did someone mention inflation? It’s all sweet and sugar for Exceptional & Rich Agro 8, which is up 55.85% since Jan 2021, cracking up an outperformance of 24.25% vs. the DBA, the world’s best Agro ETF. The model uses 8 Agro ETFs as components. Barring Orange Juice, it owns all the major softs and grains.

How did E&R deliver this exceptional performance?

First: It does not MCAP size weight the components.

Second: It does not rebalance with every price change.

Third: E&R is really passive, it is not S&P 500 Passive.
