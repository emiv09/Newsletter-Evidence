title: Tale of Two Trents
---

Once upon a market, in India, there was a company named Trent, a name that doesn't quite echo the giants of industry but rather whispers the promise of potential. In January 2023, two basket makers, S&P and E&R, faced a decision regarding this modest contender. Their approaches, starkly different, led them down divergent paths with notably disparate outcomes.

S&P, the storied indexer, often revered for its broad and unwavering lens, earmarked Trent with a weight of under 1%. In S&P's grand tapestry of stocks, size matters significantly. Trent, not ranking among the top titans, found no favor in S&P's methodological rigor. It was a mere footnote, a small player in a league dominated by behemoths.

On the other hand, E&R, smaller and perhaps nimbler, took a different view. For E&R, the market is not just a battleground of giants but a field ripe with opportunity for all. Size was not the sole determinant but rather the potential for relative growth that guided their hands. Trent was seen not just as a company but as a company of untapped potential. E&R automated process overweighted Trent, assigning it a weight of more than 3% in their basket.

The months rolled by, and the market's waves tossed and turned. 516 days later, the narrative of Trent took a dramatic turn—the stock soared nearly 300%. This meteoric rise was not just a win for Trent but a monumental victory for E&R. While S&P's conservative gamble relegated it to modest gains, E&R's foresighted strategy bore fruit, splendidly so.

The result? E&R India 100 outpaced S&P BSE 100 by nearly 20%, delivering an annualized return of more than 40%, all grounded in real money. This disparity in returns underscores a broader theme in investment philosophy: the scale of investment does not always correlate with the scale of returns. Sometimes, it's the overlooked avenues that lead to the richest destinations.

As the market continues to evolve, the tale of two Trents serves as a compelling narrative on investment strategies. It highlights that in the complex dance of stock indexing and portfolio management, sometimes taking the road less traveled by weighing potential over size can lead one to undiscovered fortunes.
