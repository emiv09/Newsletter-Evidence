# AlphaBlock Rating for Funds


Today, we are excited to introduce our new rating service for funds: AlphaBlock Rating. This service ranks funds across five crucial parameters to provide a comprehensive and insightful evaluation of their performance.

## Overall Performance

The first parameter is Overall Performance. To be included in our ratings, a fund must outperform either its category peer benchmark or the broad market since inception. Funds that fail to beat both benchmarks are excluded from our coverage. A fund that surpasses either benchmark earns a minimum of one star in our rating system. This category does not differentiate between older and newer funds, but rather gives newer funds with less history an opportunity to be rated if they deliver overall performance.

## Adjusted Performance

Adjusted Performance is the second parameter and addresses the inherent concentration in mutual funds compared to their benchmarks. Typically, active mutual funds contain 20-40 stocks, whereas benchmarks may comprise over 100 stocks. This discrepancy makes direct comparisons of funds with their respective benchmarks challenging. Therefore, we evaluate adjusted performance by excluding the best benchmark return years to assess if the fund’s selections perform well during less favorable market conditions. While a concentrated fund portfolio may naturally excel in a booming market, its true quality is revealed during downturns or years with average annualized returns. A better fund will pass this test with flying colors, while a poor fund will falter in this test.

## Recovery Speed

Recovery Speed is another rigorous test that distinguishes strong funds from weak ones. A weak fund may experience less severe drawdowns, but only a robust fund will recover swiftly from market lows. This parameter measures how quickly a fund can rebound after a decline, highlighting its resilience, quality of the fund selections and construction of the fund. Recovery matters to long term investors. If they they know that historically a certain fund recovers twice as fast as the respective benchmarks they can confidently stay invested in the fund during a momentum crash or bear market.

## Rolling Average Performance

Rolling Average Performance provides a dynamic view of a fund’s consistency. We examine three-year rolling average periods to determine how often a fund outperforms or underperforms its respective benchmark. A poorly designed fund typically shows underperformance more than 30% of the time, whereas a well designed fund may outperform over 70% of the time. This metric offers investors a clearer picture of the fund's reliability over a 3 year rolling investment period.

## Starting Point Performance

Starting Point Performance is a challenging test even for top-performing funds. This parameter addresses starting point bias, which is crucial for investors. Funds are tested for different starting points to check if they can deliver despite a different starting point. A high-quality fund delivers consistent outperformance regardless of when an investor invests in the fund. Conversely, a poorly designed fund will fail to overcome this bias, performing poorly across various starting points. Only well designed funds can ace this criteria.

## The Need for Comprehensive Ratings

As of 2023, there are nearly 150,000 mutual funds globally. Of these, approximately 5,000 have more than $1 billion in assets, totalling about $10 trillion. For global investors, a more nuanced rating system is essential. While Morningstar ratings are widely recognized, they often overlook critical factors such as drawdown, recovery speed, adjusted performance, and starting point bias. This oversight makes Morningstar ratings less relevant for investors navigating vast amounts of information.

## The Importance of Statistical Analytics

To accurately rate funds, statistical analytics are indispensable. Without thorough metrics and detailed analysis, fund ratings can mislead investors. It is crucial to educate investors on using statistical tools to evaluate fund performance effectively. Properly ranked funds empower investors, helping them make informed decisions in an increasingly complex financial landscape.

With AlphaBlock Rating, we aim to provide a more robust and insightful evaluation of mutual funds, ensuring investors have the necessary tools to make the best possible investment choices.

In our first coverage, we have analyzed 9 Small Cap Funds in India. The peer group benchmark is BSE Small Cap Index and the broad benchmark is BSE 500. Five of the 9 funds have failed the tests and are rated 2 and 1. While four funds have passed the tests and retained 3 and 4 rating. None of the funds got a rating of 5.
