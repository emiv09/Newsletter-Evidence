# “By 2027, 16% of existing asset and wealth management organizations will have been swallowed up or have fallen by the wayside.”

The report does not answer the following question. What about Alpha generation makes it difficult? Is it information? Is it mathematics? Is it because we need modern Science? Is AI expected to solve these problems? How is AI going to be implemented in the 50% passive of the total global AuM which is already transparent and low-cost?
