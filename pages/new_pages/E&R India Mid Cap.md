E&R India Mid Cap Select Achieves Remarkable 257% Growth Since January 2021

In an era marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, E&R India Mid Cap Select has achieved a stunning 257% growth since January 2021, outperforming during a challenging global context. This impressive growth in Indian Mid Cap stocks, averaging an annualized return of 38.55%, signals a robust phase for this market segment, notably outshining many others during this period.

Contrastingly, the broader Indian small cap sector also showed significant growth. Notably, the [Minerva India Underserved funds](https://github.com/alphablockorg/SandBox---Visuals/blob/main/Validations/Minerva%20India%20Under-served%20Scorecard.pdf), an AlphaBlock client, witnessed a remarkable surge of 436.9% for the same period, defying expectations of the global economic downturns and suggesting a unique resilience in the Indian market.

Simultaneously, the S&P India Mid Cap Index also recorded strong performance, albeit trailing slightly with a 159% increase over the same timeframe, translating to an annualized return of 17.42% an underperformance of 20.36%. This comparison raises the question: How did E&R achieve such extraordinary returns? The answer lies in its novel methodology. Unlike the market capitalization-weighted S&P Indian Mid Cap Index, E&R employs a bias-agnostic strategy, not solely focused on large-cap or 'winner' stocks. This broader approach helps in capturing diverse growth opportunities across the market spectrum, often overlooked in traditional, market-cap focused strategies.

In conclusion, E&R's exceptional performance underscores a shift in investment strategies, moving away from traditional market-cap weighted models towards more comprehensive, inclusive approaches that capture a wider range of market dynamics, signifying a new era in the pursuit of exceptional investment returns.
