# Is it true that for MSCI methodology, near 70% of the World is USA?

I queried the ChatGPT about MSCI World Index, for its investment thesis, institutional mandate alignment, trade offs, risks, potential enhancements etc. As of Jan 25, 2023 the iShares MSCI World ETF had around USD 2.7 billion allocated to the Index. The near 70% concentration to one country [U.S.] and 30% to the other 22 developed countries is another example of how MCAP method creates concentration and challenge for individual and institutional investors who seek diversification. There is a need for a better methodology and a way to assist Investors. And alignment starts by educating investors regarding the challenges of an 1871 MCAP method that is doing a poor job for investors. 

**What is MSCI World?**

MSCI World is a stock market index that tracks the performance of large and mid-cap companies in 23 developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Japan. It provides a broad representation of the global developed market equity universe and is often used as a benchmark for global equity portfolios by investors.

**How many assets track MSCI World?**

I don't have an up-to-date count of the exact number of assets that track the MSCI World Index. However, MSCI World is one of the most widely followed equity indices globally, and many institutional and retail investors use it as a benchmark or as the basis for passive investment products such as ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). Due to its popularity, it's likely that the number of assets tracking the MSCI World Index is substantial.

**What is the methodology?**

The MSCI World Index follows a market capitalization weighted methodology, meaning that the weight of a company in the index is determined by its market capitalization, or the total value of its outstanding shares. The index is designed to capture 85% to 90% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each country. The MSCI World Index is reviewed and reconstituted semi-annually, with changes made to ensure the index remains representative of the markets it is designed to track. The companies in the index are also screened for liquidity and other criteria to ensure they are investable. The methodology used by MSCI World is widely followed and considered to be a standard for benchmarking global equity portfolios.

**What is the investment thesis of MSCI world?**

The investment thesis of MSCI World is to provide exposure to a broad and diversified range of developed market equities. MSCI World is designed to track the performance of large and mid-cap stocks across 23 developed market countries. The index aims to capture the performance of companies that are leaders in their respective industries and have a proven track record of growth and stability. By investing in MSCI World, investors can gain exposure to a broad range of equities, which helps to reduce the overall risk of their portfolio. Additionally, MSCI World can provide a benchmark for investors to compare their own portfolio's performance with the performance of the broader market. The investment thesis of MSCI World is to provide a reliable and easily accessible means for investors to gain exposure to the developed markets, with the goal of generating long-term, risk-adjusted returns.

## *"If MSCI methodology allocates 70% in one market, would it do justice to my investment thesis?"*

**If MSCI methodology allocates 70% in one market, would it do justice to my investment thesis?**

Having a high concentration of investments in one market, such as 70% in a single country, may not align with the investment thesis of MSCI World. The index aims to provide a broad and diversified exposure to developed market equities, and a high concentration in a single country could introduce significant risk to the portfolio.

Investing a large proportion of funds in a single country or market increases the risk of that portfolio, as the performance of that country's economy and stock market will have a greater impact on the overall portfolio performance. In contrast, a well-diversified portfolio spread across multiple countries and markets can help reduce overall risk and provide more stable returns over the long term.

Therefore, having 70% of investments in a single market in an MSCI World-focused portfolio could potentially detract from the investment thesis of providing broad and diversified exposure to developed market equities. It may be necessary to reconsider the portfolio construction and adjust the investments to better align with the desired investment thesis.

## *"If 22 countries out of 23 own 30% of the weight in the Index, how does it align with the investment thesis of investors in the MSCI World?"*
**If 22 countries out of 23 own 30% of the weight in the Index, how does it align with the investment thesis of investors in the MSCI World?**

The MSCI World Index is designed to provide exposure to developed markets across the world, and its investment thesis is to offer a broad and diversified exposure to these markets. If 22 countries out of the 23 countries in the index own 30% of the weight, it may indicate a higher concentration of the portfolio in certain countries and a potentially lower level of diversification. This higher concentration could pose a higher level of country-specific risk for investors, which may not align with the investment thesis of MSCI World investors who are seeking broad and diversified exposure to developed markets. In such a scenario, investors may want to review their portfolios and consider adjusting their investments to align more closely with their investment objectives and risk tolerance.

The methodology used for the MSCI World Index is designed to provide broad exposure to developed markets across the world. However, if a concentration of investments in a few countries leads to a significant weighting in those countries, it could pose a higher level of country-specific risk for investors and potentially create a conflict for institutional investors seeking broad exposure to the 23 countries represented in the index. In such cases, investors may want to review their portfolios and adjust their investments to align more closely with their investment objectives and risk tolerance. Additionally, it's important to note that a high concentration in one country or region does not necessarily mean lower returns, but it does increase the potential for higher volatility in the portfolio.

## "So would you say, concentration creating methodology creates a conflict for investors seeking a broad exposure to 23 countries?"

The methodology used for the MSCI World Index is designed to provide broad exposure to developed markets across the world. However, if a concentration of investments in a few countries leads to a significant weighting in those countries, it could pose a higher level of country-specific risk for investors and potentially create a conflict for institutional investors seeking broad exposure to the 23 countries represented in the index. In such cases, investors may want to review their portfolios and adjust their investments to align more closely with their investment objectives and risk tolerance. Additionally, it's important to note that a high concentration in one country or region does not necessarily mean lower returns, but it does increase the potential for higher volatility in the portfolio.

## "So, concentration may give higher returns while potentially diverging away from the mandates of investors seeking exposure to 23 developed markets?"
**So, concentration may give higher returns while potentially diverging away from the mandates of investors seeking exposure to 23 developed markets?**

Yes, that is correct. Concentration in a particular market or stock can lead to higher returns, but it can also result in deviation from the original investment thesis of gaining exposure to a broad and diversified portfolio of 23 developed markets represented in the MSCI World Index. In such a scenario, the returns could be impacted more by the performance of the concentrated market or stock, rather than a balanced representation of all the 23 countries. This can create a conflict for institutional investors seeking a broad exposure to the developed markets as represented by the MSCI World Index.

## "Do you think an improved methodology, which reduces concentration skew among 23 countries, would be a more suitable for the investors who want returns but not at the cost of a more balanced allocation among the 23 developed markets?"
**Do you think an improved methodology, which reduces concentration skew among 23 countries, would be a more suitable for the investors who want returns but not at the cost of a more balanced allocation among the 23 developed markets?**

It depends on the individual investor's goals and risk tolerance. Some investors may prioritize returns over a more balanced allocation, while others may prioritize a more balanced allocation to reduce concentration risk. An improved methodology that reduces concentration skew among the 23 countries could potentially be more suitable for investors who seek returns while avoiding the concentration risk associated with a skewed allocation. However, it is important to keep in mind that reducing concentration skew may come at the cost of potentially lower returns, and each investor must make their own decision based on their individual investment goals and risk tolerance.

**Do you think, a new methodology that could reduce concentration and also increase returns is possible? What would the investors think about that methodology?**

As a language model, I don't have opinions, but I can tell you that the investment community generally values diversification as a way to mitigate risk. Reducing concentration while increasing returns can be a challenging task, as it depends on various factors such as market conditions, individual stocks, and sectors. However, a methodology that prioritizes diversification and aims to balance allocation across different countries or markets is likely to be favored by investors who prioritize risk management in their investment strategies. Ultimately, the success of a methodology will depend on its ability to deliver consistent returns while balancing risk and allocating assets in a way that aligns with the investment thesis of its target audience.

**Is it challenging or impossible?**

It can be challenging to create a methodology that reduces concentration while still maintaining high returns. The design of a methodology that balances these conflicting goals depends on many factors, including the investment objectives of the investors, the market conditions, and the available data. It is important to consider the trade-off between concentration and returns when developing any new methodology. Ultimately, the success of a new methodology would depend on how well it aligns with the investment goals and expectations of the investors.

## "Is the job of a methodology to align with investor goals and expectations? Or can a good methodology that brings the balance between risk and return can be well embraced by investors?"
**Is the job of a methodology to align with investor goals and expectations? Or can a good methodology that brings the balance between risk and return can be well embraced by investors?**

The job of a methodology is to provide a framework for constructing an index that aligns with investor goals and expectations, while balancing risk and return. A good methodology should consider factors such as diversification, risk-return trade-off, and other relevant criteria, to produce a representative and investable index. However, the acceptability of a methodology among investors will depend on various factors, including its historical performance, the investment goals of individual investors, and the broader market conditions. Ultimately, a methodology that provides a balance between risk and return and aligns with the expectations of a large number of investors is more likely to be well embraced.

**Please summarize my conversation about MSCI World into 300 words.**

MSCI World is an index created by the financial data and analytics firm MSCI Inc. It tracks the performance of large and mid-cap companies across 23 developed countries. The MSCI World Index is widely followed by institutional investors and is used as a benchmark by various funds and ETFs.

The methodology of the index is designed to capture the performance of the companies that are representative of the performance of the equity markets in each of the 23 countries. The methodology aims to ensure that the index is a well-diversified representation of the developed market equity universe. However, the concentration of a few countries in the index, particularly the US, can skew the returns and may not align with the investment goals of all investors.

Investors who track MSCI World are looking for a broad exposure to developed market equities across multiple countries. They seek a balance between risk and return and expect the index to align with their investment goals and expectations.

In conclusion, the MSCI World Index is a widely followed benchmark for institutional investors seeking a broad exposure to the equity markets of 23 developed countries. However, the concentration of a few countries in the index can impact its alignment with the investment goals of all investors, and a more balanced methodology that reduces concentration while improving returns could be embraced by investors.
