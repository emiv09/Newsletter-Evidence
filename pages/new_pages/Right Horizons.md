# AlphaBlock Partners with Right Horizons in India to Revolutionize Investment Landscape


AlphaBlock Technologies Inc. (“AlphaBlock”), a pioneer in cutting-edge machine-driven investment solutions, is proud to announce its strategic partnership with Right Horizons in India, enabling High Net Worth Indian investors to access new-age investing solutions. Today’s index funds disproportionately weight a few stocks, making them concentrated and risky. The aim of this collaboration is to offer investors the opportunity to invest in more diversified portfolios, thereby reducing risk and potentially outperforming the market.

The three launch products include: Alphabots Large Cap 100 - Benchmarked to BSE 100, comprising top-quality Indian companies with substantial growth potential. Alphabots Large Cap 30 - Benchmarked to Sensex 30, providing exposure to India's leading large-cap stocks. Alphabots Mid Cap focusing on mid-cap companies and benchmarked to BSE Mid Cap Select Index.

Mukul Pal, Founder and CEO of AlphaBlock, stated, "India is the world's fifth-largest economy and one of the fastest-growing emerging markets, with a colossal USD 3 trillion market capitalization. Yet, it does not have access to modern investment instruments. Traditional investing instruments lack innovation and rely on methodologies dating back to 1871. These outdated approaches have resulted in misrepresentation and underperformance of passive investments."

AlphaBlock is determined to fundamentally reshape the investment landscape. The mission is clear: to mitigate the concentration risks inherent in current indexing methodologies and dispel the myth of active underperformance. By providing active managers with superior solutions and services, AlphaBlock is ushering in a new era of investment. The objective is simple – to generate greater wealth for investors and establish a financial environment where exceptional performance is the norm, not the exception. This mission aligns with the relentless pursuit of knowledge in modern science and the unwavering resolve to allow investors to participate and benefit from India's remarkable growth narrative.

Anil Rego, CEO of Right Horizons, added, "We are thrilled about this partnership as it empowers our clients to access an active strategy while maintaining risk levels similar to passive index investments. At Right Horizons, we firmly believe that Artificial Intelligence and financial market innovation will significantly enhance the efficiency of existing investment solutions."
