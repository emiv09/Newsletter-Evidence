# Long Live Broker Dealers!

Broker-dealers are facing a challenging time, as a result of changing regulations, the impact of technology, and the commoditization of the industry. The rise of robo-advisors and online brokers has put pressure on fees, making it harder for broker-dealers to differentiate themselves from their competitors. However, there may be a breakthrough technology that could help broker-dealers navigate these challenges and provide more value to their clients: new-age index funds that charge fees only on performance.

**The Pain of Broker-Dealers**

Broker-dealers have been facing a series of regulatory changes over the past few decades. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, there was a push for greater transparency and accountability in the financial industry. This led to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, which brought sweeping changes to the regulation of broker-dealers.

One of the main impacts of Dodd-Frank was the creation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which is responsible for overseeing broker-dealers and enforcing compliance with regulatory requirements. This has increased the cost of compliance for broker-dealers, as they now need to devote more resources to ensuring that they are meeting regulatory requirements.

In addition to regulatory changes, broker-dealers are also facing pressure from the impact of technology. The rise of robo-advisors and online brokers has made it easier for investors to manage their portfolios and execute trades without the need for a traditional broker-dealer. This has put pressure on fees and made it harder for broker-dealers to differentiate themselves from their competitors.

The commoditization of the industry has also made it more difficult for broker-dealers to stand out. With so many solutions offering to do the same thing, it can be hard for broker-dealers to demonstrate their unique value proposition to clients.

**The Disruptor Gets Disrupted**

As the industry becomes more commoditized, there is a risk that the disruptor will eventually become disrupted. The rise of robo-advisors and online brokers has put pressure on traditional broker-dealers, but these disruptors are also facing their challenges.

For example, robo-advisors and online brokers have struggled to differentiate themselves from their competitors, leading to a race to the bottom on fees. This has made it harder for them to generate sustainable profits, and many have had to pivot their business models to survive.

Similarly, the shift towards passive investing has made it harder for active investment managers to generate alpha and justify their fees. This has led to a wave of fee compression in the industry, as investors have become more price-sensitive and less willing to pay high fees for active management.

**A Breakthrough Technology?**

Despite these challenges, there may be a breakthrough technology that could help broker-dealers navigate the changing landscape of the industry: new-age index funds that charge fees only on performance.

Unlike traditional index funds, which charge fees based on the assets under management (AUM), new-age index funds only charge fees when they outperform their benchmark. 

New-age index funds also have the potential to deliver more value to investors than traditional index funds. By using modern science and innovation, these Index funds could help investors to generate alpha and create more wealth from their passive investments. This could help increase transparency and trust between broker-dealers and their clients.

Another potential benefit of new-age index funds is that they could foster collaboration between broker-dealers and new technology companies allowing them to share performance-based fees, which not only them to differentiate but create a blue - ocean market place, which takes the industry to a new paradigm.
