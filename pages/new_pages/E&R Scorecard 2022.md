Exceptional & Rich [E&R] Scorecard 2022

Did you know that if you can beat the S&P 500 by 100 basis points [1%] net of fees you are in the top decile of asset managers in the world? Did you know that E&R is an open methodology which improves on the concentration challenges of the market capitalization weighting method? Did you know E&R factor framework is open and can be accessed on GitHub? Did you know that you can try our passive Indexes on a pay-for-alpha model using our Electronic Investment Funds? Did you know that our current running five Indexes delivered on average 944 basis points [9.44%] above their respective ETFs? Did you know that E&R Indexes are published daily?

SBI BSE 100 India Fund was compared vs. E&R India 100, SPY was compared vs. E&R U.S. 500, XIU was compared vs. E&R Canada 60, BITW was compared vs. E&R Crypto 10 and EIDO was compared vs. E&R Indonesia 30. All the green coloured histograms depict the annual excess returns for the year 2022. All the E&R Indexes are passive and contain the same number of components as their respective ETFs.

<div align="center"><em>[AR] Annualized Average Returns, [ER] Annualized Excess Returns, [EV] Average Excess Volatility, [TE] Average Annual Tracking Error, [AA] Asset Allocation based on inverse of Tracking Error [TE]</em><br><br></div>

Though there was a dispersion across performance and risk metrics, the Average Annualized returns [AR] when weighted with inverse of Tracking Error could have delivered an average simulated return for the year at negative 128 basis points [-1.28%] even after assuming Crypto risk. As we add more Indexes like commodities, alternative energy, the asset allocation models should become more insightful.
