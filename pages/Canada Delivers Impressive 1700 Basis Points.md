# "YTD E&R Canada Delivers Impressive 1700 Basis Points, Outperforming Market Benchmarks"

Year-to-date, Exceptional & Rich Canada (E&R Canada) has achieved a remarkable 1700 basis points (bps) in returns. Recently, I was asked about the underwhelming performance of equity models compared to fixed income instruments' interest earnings. While machines have the ability to make various changes to equity models, one thing they cannot currently do is increase interest rates. Therefore, machines play a crucial role in maintaining the vitality of equity markets.

So far this year, our Exceptional & Rich Canada 60 has delivered an astonishing return of 16.73%. This performance exceeds the S&P TSX 60's return by more than 10% during the same period, with a marginal excess volatility of approximately 2%.

Machines possess a vast potential beyond their current capabilities. The widely popular TSX 60 ETF, XIU.TO, manages over 10 billion CAD. While a 6.39% return may appear mediocre, surpassing inflation, a return of 16.73% should alleviate concerns regarding inflation for both Canadian passive investors and global investors who doubt the machine's ability to construct superior index funds.
