# How is OEF losing $16.8 million in fees and 5% annually to global investors?

OEF is the ETF that allows investors exposure to the S&P 100, has $8 B in assets as of September 30, 2023. So, how is it losing global investors so much money?

There are multiple ways to explain this. The first is the do-it-yourself rule.

Why would you pay 0.2% to your ETF to package the S&P 100 if you could do it yourself at Alpaca for zero cost? Now, you may say buying 100 stocks, curating that basket, managing corporate actions, etc., are good enough reasons for you to pay those annual fees. But what if I tell you that OEF allocates 50% of all your money in 10 stocks and 70% in 30 stocks, instead of offering real diversification. You might start to understand how a simple chatbot, connected to a wealth tech app, connected to a zero-fee brokerage account, can do the same for zero cost. It should concern you that someone is charging you a 0.2% fee every year for selling you 10 stocks, which don’t change very frequently. And it should bother you when you realize that millions of clients, pooled together, create a business that makes $16.8 million in annual recurring revenue by repackaging. I understand it’s not that painful, and you are wealthy and don’t really believe that you can beat OEF by doing things yourself or buying an alternative. Okay, let me ask you something else.

Has the S&P 100 ever yielded more than 38.8% annually since its launch as an ETF in 2000?

The answer is no.

However, could it have yielded 38.8% annual gain?

The answer is yes.

The S&P 100, which OEF packages as a fund, has a simple approach to building a basket, i.e., put most of the money in the big-sized companies, aka winners. Yes, your mom can do that too, but there is a problem here. Building baskets is a science, not an art. Science understands that winners don’t always win. It also recognizes biases such as losers' bias, stocks that don’t do anything bias, winners that don’t deliver the best returns bias, winners that have become losers bias, losers that continue to remain losers bias, and losers that have become winners bias – you get the point.

When these biases are taught to machines, and they are instructed to operate without the singular approach of always investing in the winners' bias, the result is the Exceptional & Rich U.S. 100 Model. It outperformed the benchmark by 904 basis points and ended up delivering, you guessed it, 38.8% for the year, using the same 100 stocks, doing something that 100 stocks have never done before. How’s that possible? I know, you may not have read our blog posts before or the work we have been doing forever, but yes, it’s possible.

This may sound too good to be true. You can verify this by downloading our [GitHub](https://github.com/alphablockorg) codebase, setting up a starting date, and running the models for January 2023. If you’re still not convinced, set up 10,000 starting points from January 2000 and run the models. If you’re still skeptical, you can read our [bibliography](https://github.com/alphablockorg/Research). If you still think this is too good to be true, we offer whitelabeling on a pay-for-alpha basis – yes, you pay when we beat the S&P 100. If you’re still not convinced, we can discuss markets in India, Canada, Europe, Japan, our beloved SPDRs, or even other asset classes. If you’re still not convinced, you should get ready to try Alphie, our ChatGPT App. It can answer your questions 24/7/365. We love skeptics and non-believers; they motivate us to keep going. We’re here to convince you.

Once you’re convinced, you should ask: How much money have global investors lost since 1983 due to poor, flawed, 1871 thinking? The answer depends on how much average allocation the S&P 100 has had since 1983. A better question is what we started with: How much money do investors lose buying S&P 100 every year?

Based on the OEF, as of September 30, 2023 (surprisingly, the factsheet was not updated), the calculation of the annual fee for 0.2% of $8,414,319,389 in assets under management is as follows:

0.002 × 8,414,319,389 = 16,828,638.778

So, 0.2% of $8,414,319,389 is approximately $16,828,638.778.

Yes, that’s correct. Global individual and institutional investors lose $16.8 million every year, buying into the standard and poor investing offered by the world’s largest passive investor, foregoing on average at least 4% every year on their assets. The number is 5% if you add other costs. This problem is not unique to OEF only. The issue is with the passive industry, which is predominantly based on a 'show me the winner' bias, with passive assets currently nearing $50 T. And you don’t want to get me started on the mathematics of that fees.

Your low cost passive investments are eating in your long term wealth, slowly and surely. Don't believe what you hear about the Passive funds today, they are concentrated, based on flawed design and a herding mechanism.
