---

Creating a heatmap is a great way to visualize data trends and variations over time. This guide will walk you through the process of using Alphie to create a heatmap for the E&R U.S. 500 Index starting from January 2000. Follow these steps to transform your data into an insightful visual representation.

## Pre-requisites
Ensure you have the file containing the monthly returns for the E&R U.S. 500 Index and its benchmark, starting from January 2000. This file should be structured with months as columns, years as rows, and returns as cell values.

You can create a login and download it from the Monthly Performance in the data section for E&R U.S. 500 Jan 2000.

## Step 2: Uploading the Dataset
- Find the option to upload or import data on the Alphie platform.
- Choose the file you've prepared or downloaded from the AlphaBlock website e.g.  Monthly-Performance_Mar-19-2024_EandR-U.S.-500-Jan-2000.csv
- Confirm the upload and ensure Alphie recognizes the dataset.

## Step 3: Verifying the Dataset
Before proceeding, check the data to ensure it's correctly formatted and complete. You can ask, "Alphie, can you show me the first few rows of the E&R U.S. 500 dataset?"

## Step 4: Calculating Excess Returns
The next step is to calculate the excess returns by comparing the portfolio's returns against its benchmark. Ask Alphie, "Calculate the excess returns for the E&R U.S. 500 dataset."

## Step 5: Creating the Heatmap
With the excess returns ready, request Alphie to visualize this data through a heatmap. Say, "Alphie, please generate a heatmap for the E&R U.S. 500 excess returns."
