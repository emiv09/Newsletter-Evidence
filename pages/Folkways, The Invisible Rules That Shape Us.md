# Folkways, The Invisible Rules That Shape Us


**Podcast**

A Glimpse into the Intriguing World of *Folkways*

**Have you ever wondered why we shake hands, wear certain clothes, or believe some things are right and others wrong?** These seemingly simple behaviors and beliefs are often guided by powerful, yet often invisible, forces called *folkways*. William Graham Sumner's book Folkways explores the origins and impact of these social norms, offering a fascinating perspective on human behavior that challenges assumptions and expands our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.

One of the key takeaways from *Folkways* is that **these unwritten rules are not arbitrary; they emerge from practical solutions to everyday problems**. For example, consider the development of language. The sources note that Sumner argued that language evolved organically as people sought to communicate and cooperate more effectively. Early humans, with only rudimentary sounds at their disposal, gradually developed more complex forms of communication, driven by the need to share information, coordinate actions, and build relationships. What started as simple grunts and gestures evolved into intricate systems of words and grammar, ultimately shaping the way we think and perceive the world.

Folkways, however, goes beyond simply describing these social norms; **it explores their power in shaping morality**.  Sumner introduced the term "mores" to describe folkways that have gained ethical significance, becoming deeply ingrained beliefs about right and wrong. These mores carry a weight of social obligation and can influence everything from laws and institutions to personal relationships and individual behavior.

**A captivating example of the power of mores can be found in Sumner's analysis of the changing perceptions of slavery.** He argued that while slavery was once widely accepted, evolving social norms and values eventually led to its condemnation and abolition. This shift in moral judgment was not merely a result of intellectual arguments; it was a product of changing folkways, driven by factors like economic transformations, religious ideals, and growing humanitarian sentiments. The sources point out that Sumner used this historical example to demonstrate how even deeply ingrained practices can be dismantled when social norms and values evolve.

**But what makes these unwritten rules so powerful in shaping our behavior?** *Folkways* explores the psychological mechanisms that underpin their influence, including suggestion, imitation, and social pressure. The sources note that Sumner recognized the role of these mechanisms in various aspects of life, such as advertising, politics, and fashion. He argued that our susceptibility to suggestion, our tendency to imitate others, and our desire for social acceptance make us highly responsive to the influence of folkways and mores, often without even realizing it.

**The book also examines the role of social selection in shaping societies.** Sumner argued that folkways and mores act as a filtering mechanism, favoring individuals and groups who conform to established norms while marginalizing those who deviate. He used historical examples, such as the witch persecutions, to show how fear, prejudice, and social pressure can lead to the persecution of individuals who are perceived as different or threatening.
