title: Wall Street Learns. This Year, Everything Beats the S&P 500
---

The [corrected Bloomberg headline](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-17/wall-street-s-s-p-500-profit-outlooks-haven-t-budged-as-world-changes?embedded-checkout=true) might seem unlikely for 2024, but it's statistically feasible. In fact, for this headline to turn into reality, 51% of active mandates must outperform the S&P 500. Surpassing the S&P 500 isn't just feasible; the real challenge lies in changing perceptions. Active management isn't fading away; it's poised for a resurgence starting in 2024. Let’s explore why the original Bloomberg headline was misguided and required correction.

**Firstly**, the S&P 100 ETF (OEF) significantly outperformed the S&P 500, contradicting the notion that nothing beats the S&P 500. A single example, such as this, is sufficient to challenge the idea that the S&P 500 is the ultimate benchmark for investment management.

<br>

**Secondly**, if we consider a scenario where 'A' beats 'B', and 'C' beats 'A', then 'C' emerges as the winner. Therefore, if something surpasses the S&P 100's 30% return, we have a clear victor. Only four companies from the S&P 100’s top 10 by weight made it to this year’s top performers list, indicating the possibility of outperforming the S&P 100.

<div align="center"><em>Table 1 – S&P 100 had only four of their top 10 allocation in the top 10 winners this year</em><br><br></div>

<br>

**Thirdly**, among the S&P 100’s top 10 by weight, only 8 were part of the 22 stocks that exceeded the S&P 100’s 32% return. This means that a portfolio of 14 stocks, not in the S&P 100's top 10 by weight, outperformed the index, demonstrating that the S&P 100 was indeed beatable with diverse weighting methodologies.

<br>

**Fourthly**, indexes operate on open rules. The S&P 100 follows a transparent methodology. Our E&R S&P 100 Index, running since January 2023, outstripped the S&P 100 by a staggering 1000 basis points. This suggests that with an alternative methodology, it's possible to find oneself on the favourable side of statistics, a promising outlook for 2024 and beyond.

**Fifthly**, the rarity of consistently achieving new highs is noteworthy. Since the peak in January 2020, it has taken three years to reach new highs, a significant acceleration compared to the 12 years it took from 2000. The E&R U.S. 100 Index, starting in 2013, already reached a new high in November this year. This indicates that benchmarks built on dynamic systems, as opposed to static MCAP-weighted methodologies, can achieve new highs even under challenging conditions.
