# Indexing Gone Wrong. Are Alphabet's Dual Share Classes Creating Governance and Risk Challenges?


Should the inclusion of both Alphabet’s share classes, GOOG (non-voting) and GOOGL (voting), in major indices such as the S&P 500 raise critical concerns about governance and risk exposure in passive investing? Traditionally, indices are designed to offer a diversified reflection of the market, yet Alphabet’s dual share inclusion since 2014 distorts this principle, inflating the company’s influence on the index and creating concentration risks, specially now when the company is under legal pressure.

## Multiple Share Classes and Index Governance
The issue begins with how different indices handle Alphabet’s dual shares. The **S&P 500**, driven by its index committee, chose to include both GOOG and GOOGL, giving Alphabet nearly **3.5% weight** in the index. In contrast, the **Nasdaq US 500 Large Cap Index** takes a more rules-based approach, including only the most liquid share class, GOOGL, thereby avoiding the inflated influence. This distinction highlights a governance challenge: should an index’s methodology allow for such over-representation of a single company?

## The Problem of Overweighting and Systemic Risk
When multiple share classes are included in an index, companies like Alphabet hold disproportionate weight. The inflated position of Alphabet, combined with its recent underperformance, as seen in a **1.28% drop** in its Class C shares (GOOG), demonstrates the risk. If Alphabet continues to underperform, ETFs and funds tied to indices like the S&P 500 could suffer significantly. This concentration drives **systemic risks**, making every market participate more vulnerable to a single company’s decline.

## Herding Mechanism of Market Capitalization
Market capitalization-based indices, such as the S&P 500, inherently create a **herding mechanism**. As Alphabet’s market cap grows, so does its influence on the index, forcing passive investors to increase their exposure. This behavior can inflate asset bubbles and increase volatility, pushing investors toward a few dominant companies and creating an unsustainable feedback loop.

## Impact on Passive Investors, Especially Pensioners
Pensioners and passive investors are unknowingly exposed to concentrated risk when they invest in index funds or ETFs. With both GOOG and GOOGL in the S&P 500, retirees who rely on these funds for their financial security are now tied to Alphabet’s fate. Do Index committees make inclusion decisions keeping in mind the long-term impact on investors who expect broad diversification but are now subject to the overexposure to a few tech giants?

## The Trade-off Between Control and Innovation
Alphabet’s dual-class structure exists to maintain control by its founders, particularly through voting rights embedded in GOOGL. However, this raises a critical trade-off between **control and innovation**. When a company is overly focused on maintaining control, does it risk stifling its ability to innovate and adapt to market challenges? If Alphabet’s management continues to prioritize control, can the company find itself increasingly unable to compete, which could result in broader index underperformance?

## Potential Antitrust Breakup
The recent scrutiny surrounding Alphabet, including potential antitrust actions and a possible breakup of the company, further underscores the risk for passive investors. If Alphabet is forced to restructure, indices that rely heavily on both GOOG and GOOGL could face significant volatility, further complicating the performance of ETFs tied to these indices.
